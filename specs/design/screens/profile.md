# **Profile**

Everything lives on **one continuous scroll page**, broken into **expandable/collapsible sections**, each editable inline.

### **Sections:**

1. **Basic Info**
2. **Experience**
3. **Skills**
4. **Education & Certifications**
5. **Portfolio / Projects**
6. **Career Preferences**
    
No side-tabs. No rigid grids. No formal “form page”.  
Everything becomes **inline-editable**, Notion-like, and job-agnostic.

> 
> **Skills Demonstrated:** Leadership, Strategy, AI Adoption, DevOps

# 5. **Portfolio / Notable Projects**

Especially helpful for non-tech roles too:

# WHY THIS IS BETTER

### More human, less “form-like”

Users feel like they're describing themselves—not filling out tax paperwork.

### Works for ALL professions

Not tech-only. Not corporate-only.

### Mirrors LinkedIn mental model

Everyone knows that layout already. There’s zero cognitive friction.

### Cleaner data for your AI

Professional summary  
Experience blocks  
Skill taxonomy  
Preferences

All of these become **highly AI-usable** with fewer noisy fields.

### Plays beautifully with the sheet/update model

Editing anything expands or slides into a side panel.
